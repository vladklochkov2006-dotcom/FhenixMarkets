            <p>
              Participating in prediction markets involves substantial financial risk. The value of your
              positions can fluctuate significantly, and you may lose your entire investment. Only participate
              with funds you can afford to lose. Fhenix Markets does not provide financial advice, and nothing
              on the Protocol should be construed as such.

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-4">2. Smart Contract Risk</h2>
            <p className="mb-3">
              The Protocol is powered by smart contracts deployed on the Fhenix network. These contracts carry inherent risks:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-surface-400">
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Code Vulnerabilities:</strong> Despite testing and review, smart contracts may contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities that could result in loss of funds.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Immutability:</strong> Once deployed, smart contract code cannot be easily modified. Fixes may require deploying new contracts and migrating state.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Composability Risk:</strong> The Protocol interacts with multiple on-chain contracts (FhenixMarkets.sol for ETH markets, FhenixMarketsUSDCX.sol for USDCX markets, FhenixMarketsUSAD.sol for USAD markets, and FhenixGovernance.sol for governance). Issues in any component could affect the entire system.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-4">3. Blockchain & Network Risk</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-surface-400">
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Network Congestion:</strong> High network activity may cause transaction delays or failures.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Transaction Fees:</strong> Fhenix transactions require gas fees that may vary. Failed transactions may still incur fees.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Testnet Risk:</strong> The Protocol is currently deployed on the Fhenix Testnet. Testnet tokens have no real value, and the network may be reset at any time.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Network Upgrades:</strong> Fhenix network upgrades or hard forks could affect the Protocol's functionality or your holdings.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Finality:</strong> Blockchain transactions are irreversible. Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be undone.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-4">4. Market Risk</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-surface-400">
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Price Volatility:</strong> Market share prices are determined by the FPMM (Fixed Product Market Maker) algorithm and can change rapidly based on trading activity.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Liquidity Risk:</strong> Markets with low liquidity may result in high slippage, meaning you may receive significantly less value than expected.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Resolution Risk:</strong> Markets are resolved through a Multi-Voter Quorum system (not automated oracles). After a market closes, anyone can vote on the outcome by posting a 1 ETH bond, requiring a minimum of 3 voters to reach quorum. After the voting window (~3 hours), votes are finalized, followed by a dispute window (~3 hours) where anyone can override the result by posting 3x the total bonds. Voters who vote with the majority can claim rewards, while those who vote against the majority lose their bond (slashing). The process is human-initiated and may be subject to errors or disputes.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Voter Slashing Risk:</strong> If you participate in market resolution voting and your vote does not match the final outcome, your 1 ETH bond is slashed. Only vote on outcomes you are confident about.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Impermanent Loss:</strong> Liquidity providers face impermanent loss risk when the market price diverges from the initial provision ratio. The FPMM formula (x * y = k) means LP value may decrease as outcomes become more certain.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">LP Share Non-Transferability:</strong> LP shares are currently non-transferable due to claim key constraints. You cannot transfer your liquidity position to another wallet.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-4">5. Fee Risk</h2>
            <p className="mb-3">
              The Protocol charges a total trading fee of 2.0% on each buy transaction, distributed as follows:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-surface-400">
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Protocol Fee:</strong> 0.5% — sent to the protocol treasury.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Creator Fee:</strong> 0.5% — sent to the market creator.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">LP Fee:</strong> 1.0% — retained in the AMM pool as rewards for liquidity providers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3 text-surface-400">
              Fees are deducted before the AMM pool calculation. Fee rates may be changed through governance proposals (requires 20% quorum and 72-hour timelock).
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-4">6. Stablecoin Risk</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-surface-400">
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">USAD & USDCX:</strong> The Protocol supports three tokens, each with its own market contract: native ETH (FhenixMarkets.sol), USDCX (FhenixMarketsUSDCX.sol), and USAD (FhenixMarketsUSAD.sol). These test stablecoin tokens may not maintain their peg to USD and have no guaranteed backing.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">De-peg Risk:</strong> Stablecoins can lose their peg due to market conditions, smart contract issues, or governance failures.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Two-Transaction Flow:</strong> Buying shares with USDCX or USAD requires two sequential blockchain transactions (deposit to public, then buy). If the first transaction succeeds but the second fails, your funds may be temporarily locked in the contract's public balance until you retry.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Separate Contract Risk:</strong> Each token type operates through its own smart contract (ETH via FhenixMarkets.sol, USDCX via FhenixMarketsUSDCX.sol, USAD via FhenixMarketsUSAD.sol). This multi-contract architecture adds composability risk.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-4">7. Privacy & Security Risk</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-surface-400">
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Key Management:</strong> If you lose your private keys or permits, you will permanently lose access to your funds and cannot recover them.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Wallet Security:</strong> The security of your funds depends on the security of your wallet software and the device you use.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Privacy Limitations:</strong> While Fhenix provides strong privacy guarantees, metadata analysis or user behavior patterns could potentially compromise privacy.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-surface-300">Phishing:</strong> Always verify you are accessing the official Fhenix Markets website. Phishing attacks may attempt to steal your credentials.</li>

            <p>
              The regulatory landscape for prediction markets and cryptocurrency is evolving and varies by
              jurisdiction. Changes in law or regulation could restrict or prohibit the use of the Protocol
              in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable
              laws and regulations.
